# Json Validator For Laravel
A package for validating JSON data in Laravel

I developed this package to teach programming concepts to my students in the classroom.
But I think it will be useful for you too

I hope I can expand it.ðŸ˜Š

If you like to develop it, it will definitely be useful for other programmers, especially beginners.

# Requirement
* Laravel 6, 7, 8, 9
* PHP 7.4 , 8


# Installation:
```
composer require hesami/laravel-json-validator
```


# How To use:

To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an object:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_object']
]);
```


To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an array:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_array']
]);
```


To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an object that has a key or keys:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_object', 'json_object_has_key:title,desc']
]);
```


To check that the input is a Json string and contains an array whose items have a key or keys:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_array', 'json_array_items_has_key:title,desc']
]);
```


To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an array that has a certain number (10 or ...) of objects:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_array', "json_array_items_count:$count"]
]);
```


To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an array containing at least $min objects:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_array', "json_array_items_min:$min"]
]);
```


To check that the input data is a Json string and contains an array that has at most :max objects:
```
Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'movies' => ['json', 'json_array', "json_array_items_max:$max"]
]);
```
